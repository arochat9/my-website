        <h2>Sailing!</h2>
        <p>
          Since I was a kid, I have grown up competitivly sailing.  In highschool, I was elected as team captain, where I took our team to Nationals. It was the first time my school had ever qualified, and we were even the first team in New York State to ever qualify! I also coached sailing for two summers and was the president of my college sailing team.  Now, I mostly sail for fun.  Once in a while, I will participate in a local regatta with some friends.

        <h2>Skiing</h2>
        <p>
          Skiing is a hobby that I have always really enjoyed.  I grew up skiing on the east coast, often going to Mountains such as Stratton, Bromley, Sugarbush, and Whiteface. Whenever I go skiing, I love to seek out terrain parks, since doing big jumps has always been really exciting for me.  Currently, my best trick is a 360, however I am always looking to improve!

        <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
        <p>
          Recently, I have started getting into rock climbing. To me, rock climbing is a great way to get exercise and challenge myself. Over the summer, I was able to do some climbing in Acadia National Park, Maine. Now that I have my own equipment, I hope to be able to persue this hobby more frequently.

        <h2>Surfing</h2>
        <p>
          Surfing is another hobby that I have been practicing for a while.  Growing up, I was fortunate enough to have cousins that lived near the beach, so they were able to teach me the basics.  Then, Junior year I went abroad to Sydney Australia, where I would rent a board as often as I could.  Now, I am more then capable on the water, and I really enjoy surfing in rougher conditions with bigger waves.  Someday I hope to get barreled inside a wave!
