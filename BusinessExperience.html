        <h2>Category Specialist at Walmart eCommerce</h2>
        <p>
          At Walmart, I was a buyer for the bottled coffee and tea eCommerce category.  My responsibilities include site merchandising, supply chain, and vendor relations. Additionally, I spent time optimizing page layout and content, taking into consideration market research and data centered around high volume search terms.  Furthermore, I conducted analysis on new product lines that included profitability, shipping costs, and marketing co-op. I also negotiated product cost and co-op with vendors including Arizona Beverages and Health-Ade Kombucha.

        <h2>Analyst at Atlas Holdings LLC</h2>
        <p>
          On the deal side, I Assisted in thorough due diligence processes for various acquisitions that included complex financial modeling, various acquisition structures, and growth projections. Furthermore, I conducted research on industries for potential deals by interviewing industry experts and market analysts to obtain industry pricing information, growth trends, and market supply & demand. I used this information to create detailed investment presentations. Next, I created value through operational improvements in distressed portfolio companies. As an example: I created inventory tracking & management systems which lowered distribution inefficiency by 90%.

        <h2>Consultant for Washington University's Small Business Initiative</h2>
        <p>
          First, I was chosen to be a member of a four-person business consulting team for Freddie Leeâ€™s Gourmet Sauces. We were tasked with building a manufacturing facility that optimizes workflow efficiency. To do this, I produced a comprehensive floorplan intended to maximize output capacity. This design included an exhaustive list of necessary factory equipment, within a $40,000 budget. Next, we also created an employee work schedule that improves factory output by distributing specific tasks between employees, while adhering to work regulation standards.
