        <h2>Deployment Lead at Palantir Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past 3 years as a deployment lead, I have developed essential leadership skills through managing a team of engineers responsible for building and maintaining multiple production applications. These experiences have honed my abilities in scoping and executing use cases, gaining executive buy-in, and enabling customers. Working on diverse projects, I have learned to communicate effectively with stakeholders at all levels and adapt my approach to their interests and priorities. Managing an implementation team has taught me the importance of prioritizing tasks, addressing challenges, and supporting team members' growth and fulfillment. A testament to this is our work with Robotics company Sarcos.  At Sarcos, I have managed a team responsible for building 5 production use cases across their enterprise, and we have shaped the company into what it is today.      </div>

        <h2>Head Teaching Assistant at Washington University in St. Louis</h2>
        <p>
          At WashU, I was employed as the head teaching assistant for CSE450 Videogame Programming where I used my technical expertise to aid students with topics including graphics, artificial intelligence, user interface design, and networking. Furthermore, I collaborated with professors and a dedicated team of fellow teaching assistants to create an effective and efficient learning environment by holding weekly office hours and grading assignments.

        <h2>VP of Programming for Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity</h2>
        <p>
          As the VP of Programming, I was elected by my peers to oversee and host social, philanthropic, and alumni events with 150+ guests in attendance. I also created and presented budget proposals to the finance committee each semester that I was in the role. This led to me managing a $10,000 budget per semester.
          Furthermore, I lead and trained ten social committee members. For social events, I delegated responsibilities to ensure adherence to risk management policies.

        <h2>Larchmont Yacht Club Junior Sailing</h2>
        <p>
          At LYC, I was an instructor for a group of 12 kids ages 9-12 on the water for 10 hours a day, 8 weeks per summer.
          This meant that I was in charge of managing and teaching kids on and off the water.  This included creating lesson plans and risk management plans, hosting chalk talks and off water lessons, running on the water drills, and debriefing practices with sailors.
          We also traveled to various national events around the Eastern Coast, where I would be solely responsible for group safety and regatta management for up to three days.  I also made sure to keep in constant communication with parents during these events.
